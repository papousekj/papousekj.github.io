Like most of the LAGO (law abiding gun owners) community, my reaction to the May OIC (Order in Council) that prohibited and proposed a buy back for certain firearms in Canada was outrage. The OIC bypassed Parliament, disregarded serious study, ignored petitions and protest and moved a step closer to the total disarming of Canadian citizens.

Whether these measures were taken for short term political gain for the minority Liberal government or more insidiously, the removal of our personal safety and freedoms as a step toward the dystopian socialist New World Order, the move is nothing short of treacherous overreach by those who are pushing Canada towards a “post national state”.

As the firearms community struggles with the ramifications of the prohibitions, the Liberals merrily move on to the next phase of bankrupting our resource , manufacturers and small business sectors mostly by trying to use fear as the instrument of control. And because they dismiss all logic and especially common sense in their desire to control every aspect of Canadian endeavor, the only way to bring sanity back to the nation is to remove and keep this group of immoral and anti-Canadian Liberals from ever holding power in Canada again.

I have always loved my country and I am ready to do whatever I can as one of millions of voices to bring back the vision that made Canada one the world’s greatest nations.
